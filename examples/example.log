FINISHING PROGRAM. GENERAL INFO
Fastq file had 250019 reads, of which:
- 41 were discarded due to the presence of N's (-> *_NNNN.fq.gz)
- 5 were discarded due to low quality (-> *_lowq.fq.gz)
- 474 were trimmed due to the presence of N's (lowQ and cont filter)
- 4 were trimmed due to low quality (-> contamination filter)
- 49854 were classified as contaminations (-> *_cont.fq.gz)
- 200119 were classified as good reads (-> *_good.fq.gz)
